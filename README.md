# manifest-aws
Current manifest for the service running on AWS for practable.io

This repo contains the latest version of the manifest for the live service, and the scripts required to upload it to the booking server. 

## Pre-requisites

Build the `book` command from [relay](https://github.com/practable/relay.git) and put on your path, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`

```
git clone https://github.com/practable/relay.git
cd relay/cmd/book
go build
sudo cp book /usr/local/bin
```

check it exists:
```
$ book
Book provides commands for a booking server and client, including 
managing instant-access bookings for equipment, uploading bookings, resetting
the booking server, getting the booking server status, and generating new
tokens to access the booking server.

Usage:
  book [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  getstatus   Get the lock status and message of the day
  help        Help about any command
  reset       Delete all activities, pools and groups in the booking server.
  serve       Start the booking server
  setstatus   Set the lock status and message of the day
  token       session token generates a new token for authenticating to book
  upload      Upload a manifest of activities, pools and groups to booking server

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.book.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for book
  -t, --toggle          Help message for toggle

Use "book [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


## Authorization

The scripts require a credential to work. This credential is not contained in the repo, because it is private to the admin team.

To supply the credential to the scripts, create a directory `secret` in your repo, and put the booking secret into `./secret/book.pat`

If you get this correct, then the script will run fine. Else, you will receive this message

```
cat: ./secret/book.pat: No such file or directory
export BOOK_SECRET before running script
```

Do not remove the entry `secret/` from `.gitignore`, because this will allow the secret to be included in the repo.


## Editing 

Make changes to the manifest, and compare to previous known-good version using `git diff`

## testing

You can test your new manifest by uploading to the test server (this is created at the start of the `test_serve.sh` script)

```
$ ./test_serve.sh

commands:
  g: start insecure chrome
  l: Lock bookings
  n: uNlock bookings
  r: reset the poolstore (has confirm)
  s: get the status of the poolstore)
  t: serve the everyone token on port 4001
  u: re-upload manifest
What next? [l/n/r/s/t/u]:
```
Practice run
0. issue `s` and copy the datetime from the status message
```
{
	"last_booking_ends": 1657100538,
	"msg": "Open for bookings"
}
```
0. in a separate terminal, `date -d @xxxxx` where xxxx is the datetime (remember the `@`!)

```
$ date -d @1657100538
Wed  6 Jul 10:42:18 BST 2022
```
0. Obviously there are no relevant bookings running on our test server, but this shows the approach.
0. use `r` to delete all existing manifest entries, confirm with `yes`, then check the status
You will now see 
```
reset complete
What next? [l/n/r/s/t/u]:s
{
	"last_booking_ends": 1657100683,
	"msg": "Open for bookings"
}
```
This empty status message shows the manifest has been emptied out as required.

0. use `u` to upload your (tested) manifest, confirm with `y`

You will now see what is being uploaded - the order may vary and contents be different depending on the manifest at the time

```
Definitely upload [y/N]?y

0. If you have a local version of the booking app, you can point it at the booking app running in the test script (see information at the start of the test script, note that the port number xxxxx is randomly assigned and varies from run to run)

```
book server at localhost:xxxxx (testing)
```
0. Now you can reset `r`, and check status `s`, and see that the status returns to:
```
{
	"last_booking_ends": 1657101048,
	"msg": "Open for bookings"
}
```
0. Now you can upload again, and see that the status changes to 
```
<snip>

	"activities": 223,
	"groups": 12,
	"last_booking_ends": 1657100824,
	"msg": "Open for bookings",
	"pools": 86
}
```
0. Stop the test server with Ctrl-C

Note - if the test fails for any reason, or throws a seg-fault, then the manifest is missing a reference to one of the objects used to build the data structure. Judicious use of git diff should see you right for now.

## Upload

Current operating procedure is to 
0. run `serve.sh`
0. issue `s` and copy the datetime
0. in a separate terminal, `date -d @xxxxx` where xxxx is the datetime (remember the `@`!)
0. if there are no current bookings, then proceed (ok to proceed if the latest booking is your own and you can see there are no other bookings in the system - that is out of scope for this repo though). If there date is more than 1 minute into the future, then it is a human booking, else it is just a spinner demo booking. You can ignore the spinner demo bookings for this purpose.
0. open the booking page for the group you are modifying, e.g. [everyone](https://book.practable.io) and check it is alright, before you start.
0. use `r` to delete all existing manifest entries, confirm with `yes`
0. use `u` to upload your (tested) manifest, confirm with `y`
0. check the [booking system](https://book.practable.io) to see it it showing what you expect.
